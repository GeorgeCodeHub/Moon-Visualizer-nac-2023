# NASA Space Apps Challenge 2023 - Moonquake Visualization App

[LIVE APP](https://georgecodehub.github.io/Moon-Visualizer-nac-2023/)

Welcome to the NASA Space Apps Challenge 2023 Moonquake Visualization App repository! This project was developed as a
part of the NASA Space Apps Challenge 2023 with the aim of utilizing NASA's recorded data on moonquakes and effectively
visualizing them. Our goal is to provide an interactive and informative experience for users to explore lunar seismic
activity.

## Resources

To achieve our goal, we leveraged the following NASA resources:

1. [NASA Moonquakes Data](https://astrogeology.usgs.gov/search/map/Moon/LMMP/LOLA-derived/Lunar_LRO_LOLA_ClrShade_Global_128ppd_v04):
   This dataset contains valuable information about moonquakes recorded by NASA's Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter.

2. [NASA Moon Visualization](https://svs.gsfc.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/details.cgi?aid=4720): NASA's Scientific Visualization
   Studio provided stunning visual assets for enhancing the user experience.

3. [Apollo Seismic Event Catalog](https://pds-geosciences.wustl.edu/lunar/urn-nasa-pds-apollo_seismic_event_catalog/data/):
   This dataset contains additional seismic data from the Apollo missions, contributing to a comprehensive lunar seismic
   analysis.

## Technologies and Tools

We employed the following technologies and tools to develop this application:

- **React.js**: A popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces.

- **Three.js**: A 3D graphics library that allowed us to create immersive visualizations.

- **react-globe.gl**: A React component for rendering interactive 3D globes.

- **TypeScript**: A statically typed superset of JavaScript that enhances code quality and maintainability.

- **Redux Toolkit**: A state management library for managing complex application states efficiently.

- **Vite**: A fast build tool for modern web development, which helped us build and bundle the app.

## Getting Started

To initiate the app locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/moonquake-visualization-app.git
   ```
